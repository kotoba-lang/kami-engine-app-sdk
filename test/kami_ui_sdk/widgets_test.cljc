(ns kami-ui-sdk.widgets-test
  "`:clj`-side coverage for `kami-ui-sdk.widgets`: the namespace must load
   cleanly under plain Clojure (the `#?(:cljs (do ...))` DOM-impl block is
   absent from :clj compilation, not merely guarded), and every public
   entry point must throw a clear `ex-info` rather than silently no-op'ing
   or crashing obscurely on a missing `js/document`. The real DOM behavior
   is verified separately in a browser (see `dev/widgets_demo.cljs` +
   `dev/widgets_demo.html`) — ClojureScript compilation and browser
   execution aren't exercised by `clojure.test` (JVM)."
